        <h1><b>My</b> Web Page Is <b>AWESOME!</b></h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my web page. It is the coolest one there is. Here are the reasons why my page is awesome:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has a list on it</li>
            <li>It uses <i>ITALICS</i></li>
            <li>It also has <b>boooooold</b> style choices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Plus, my web page has a place to sign your name (don't ask what you're signing away...JUST DO IT): <hr/>yes...do it.
